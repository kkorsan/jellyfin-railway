24/7 and add shows inside to have a fully functional home media server with no downtime
for no cost.

take you throught the whole setup process, congrats! you now have a jellyfin server
running 24/7 with no downtime.

## 2. Adding shows to your jellyfin server

Now that you've created your very own jellyfin server, it needs shows on it right?
add a new template by right clicking onto the empty space and search for a file browser,
add it and then mount the volume below jellyfin to it, you can now upload any shows to your jellyfin
server
